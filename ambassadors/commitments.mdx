Being a Prizology Ambassador isn't about doing everything. It's about making a real impact in simple ways. Ambassadors help spread the word, share feedback, and represent Prizology in their universities and societies.

The following tasks must be completed on a monthly basis and evidenced in the Monthly Report Form.

## Minimum Responsibilities
### 1. Personal Networking
You should actively mention Prizology in your day-to-day conversations with friends, classmates, and colleagues‚Äîwhether that's over coffee, in the library, at society events, or during clinical placements. Look for natural opportunities to recommend Prizology to peers who might benefit, such as those searching for prizes, funding, or ways to boost their CV.

Don't be afraid to bring up Prizology in group settings, at socials, or even in casual chats. Sharing your own positive experiences and how the platform has helped you can go a long way in encouraging others to check it out. The goal is to make Prizology a familiar name within your network, so that when someone needs opportunities, they think of you‚Äîand of Prizology.

Remember, it's not about hard selling, but about genuinely helping your peers discover something valuable. Every conversation counts!

### 2. WhatsApp Posts
You must send all important announcements regarding Prizology as they are announced to your relevant university medical group chats

You must send at least 1x posts per month to your relevant university medical group chats with a standard advertisement to Prizology.

### Interested in Doing More?

If you've already completed your minimum requirements and are excited to represent Prizology even further, we'd love to hear from you! There are plenty of ways to get more involved and make a bigger impact, such as:

- **Representing Prizology at local or national conferences** by helping to share information, connect with attendees, and raise awareness about Prizology in person.
- **Assisting with marketing campaigns** by brainstorming ideas, supporting campaign execution, or helping to create engaging social media content that spreads the word about Prizology to a wider audience.
- **Collaborating on outreach projects** with university societies, student groups, or other organizations to introduce Prizology to new communities and foster valuable partnerships.
- **Contributing detailed feedback and suggestions** to help shape the development of new features, resources, or improvements for the platform, ensuring it continues to meet the needs of students and doctors.
- **Mentoring new ambassadors** by sharing your experiences, offering guidance, and helping to grow a supportive and active ambassador community.
