Prizology was founded with a clear purpose: to simplify the process of finding medical prizes, awards, and bursaries, saving students and doctors the time and effort of searching across numerous society websites.

The platformâ€™s growth is a collaborative effort, supported by a network of dedicated ambassadors. These ambassadors help raise awareness of Prizology, provide valuable feedback to guide its development, and contribute to building a platform that supports medical professionals in advancing their careers.

Ambassadors receive unlimited Premium access for the duration of their involvement and become part of a small, committed community working to make opportunities in medicine more accessible and transparent.
