### Why are Prizes needed?

Prizes are a clear way of demonstrating commitment to a chosen specialty, with evidence that can be presented across multiple stages of medical career progression.

In foundation applications, prizes signal initiative and academic engagement, distinguishing applicants in a competitive selection process. At specialty level, they contribute a considerable portion of the scoring, directly impacting progression into competitive fields.

Beyond their role in applications, prizes encourage innovation, critical thinking, and personal development, pushing individuals to contribute to their field outside standard training.

They represent recognition of effort, expertise, and forward-looking thinking, all of which are highly valued in modern medicine.

### What are Prizology's values?

At the core of Prizology are values of fairness, accessibility, and excellence. The platform is built to remove barriers to information, ensuring that opportunities are not restricted to those with insider knowledge or privileged networks.

Prizology values accuracy, clarity, and inclusivity, striving to create a resource that serves all healthcare trainees and professionals equally. It promotes a culture of recognition and achievement, while upholding transparency in how prizes are shared and discovered.
