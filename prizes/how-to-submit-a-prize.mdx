## Who can submit a Prize?

At the moment, individuals cannot submit prizes directly. If you are part of a local or national medical society, foundation, or organisation through work, university, or volunteering, we would love to showcase your prizes on Prizology.

## How to submit a Prize

Just send a partnership enquiry to [support@prizology.net](mailto:support@prizology.net) with your prize details and we will help get it featured.
