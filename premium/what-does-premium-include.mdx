</Card>

#### Starter

A temporary option. Provides access on a monthly basis, but far less cost-effective if you plan to use Prizology beyond a short trial. Useful only if you’re unsure about long-term commitment.

#### Institution

The recommended solution for universities, medical societies, and healthcare bodies. Offers unlimited listings, analytics, and dedicated support tailored for organizational needs.
