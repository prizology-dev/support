## Which plan is right for me?

### Scholar

The clear choice for committed users. A single payment unlocks lifetime access, future features, and peace of mind with no recurring costs. Perfect if you see yourself using Prizology throughout your medical journey.

### Starter

A temporary option. Provides access on a monthly basis, but far less cost-effective if you plan to use Prizology beyond a short trial. Useful only if youâ€™re unsure about long-term commitment.

### Institution

The recommended solution for universities, medical societies, and healthcare bodies. Offers unlimited listings, analytics, and dedicated support tailored for organizational needs.
